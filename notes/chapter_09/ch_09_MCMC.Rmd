# Markov chain Monte Carlo

## Practice problems

### 9M1

I don't expect that a uniform prior for sigma will have much of an effect on the estimates for model m9.1. The current value of sigma is 0.11, so well within the [0-1] range of the uniform prior.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
data(rugged)
d <- rugged
d$log_gdp <- log(d$rgdppc_2000)
dd <- d[ complete.cases(d$rgdppc_2000) , ]
dd$log_gdp_std <- dd$log_gdp / mean(dd$log_gdp)
dd$rugged_std <- dd$rugged / max(dd$rugged)
dd$cid <- ifelse( dd$cont_africa==1 , 1 , 2 )

## Using quadp
m8.3 <- quap(
    alist(
        log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
        mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
        a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
        b[cid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
        sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
    ) , data=dd )
precis( m8.3 , depth=2 )

## R code 9.13
dat_slim <- list(
    log_gdp_std = dd$log_gdp_std,
    rugged_std = dd$rugged_std,
    cid = as.integer( dd$cid )
)
str(dat_slim)

## R code 9.14
m9.1 <- ulam(
    alist(
        log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
        mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
        a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
        b[cid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
        sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
    ) , data=dat_slim , chains=1 )

m9.1p <- ulam(
    alist(
        log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
        mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
        a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
        b[cid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
        sigma ~ dunif( 0, 1 )
    ) , data=dat_slim , chains=1 )
```

As expected the different priors for sigma do not seem to affect the results.

### 9M2

Note: I don't like that the rethinking package has a graphics side effect. 

```{r, cache = TRUE}
## What does a dexp(0.3) mean?
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
hist(rexp(1e4, 0.3))
## This forces the parameter to be positive
## which would not be a good choice for the slope
## Currently b[1] is positive and b[2] is negative so
## dexp(0.3) will force both slopes to be positive

m9.1a <- ulam(
    alist(
        log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
        mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
        a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
        b[cid] ~ dexp( 0.3 ) ,
        sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
    ) , data=dat_slim , chains=1 )
## compare models
precis( m9.1 , depth = 2 )
precis( m9.1a , depth = 2 )
```

The new prior which forces the slope to be positive, has pushed teh b[2] to a value of 0.02 with an interval of (0 - 0.05) and, also, as a result b[1] to a value of 0.15. Only the positive values for the slope, given by the prior, are compatible with the model now.

### 9M3

How much warmup is enough? Or what is the minimum amount of warmup needed?

As he says in the chapter, it depends on what you are after. If you only want the 'map'.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
m9.1w <- ulam(
    alist(
        log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
        mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
        a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
        b[cid] ~ dexp( 0.3 ) ,
        sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
    ) , data=dat_slim , chains=1 , iter = 600)
## 500 iterations are not enough
```

I stopped getting complains after 600 iterations. 

### 9H1

I'm not sure that in the model below the "y = 1" matters because there is no deterministic model that matches "y" to anything else. A Cauchy distribution has fat tails compared to a Normal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution. The moments are not defined, but it does have a mode and median, which are equal to zero in the example below. The distributions created by the posterior should be equivalent to randomly sampling from them.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
mp <- ulam(
  alist(
    a ~ dnorm(0, 1),
    b ~ dcauchy(0, 1)
  ), data = list(y = 1), chains = 1
)

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
traceplot(mp)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))

mps <- extract.samples(mp)
mpsd <- gather(as.data.frame(mps))

ggplot(mpsd, aes(x = value, color = key)) + 
  geom_density()
```

The Cauchy is a lot more spread out than the normal. The number of effective samples is about 363 for a and 272 for b.

# How to set up models

I thought I would try to show how to set up models using other functions and this inevitably led me to reviewing a basic concept considered in earlier chapters.

## frequentist: lm

The GDP-ruggedness example can be easily set up with **lm**.

```{r}
dd$rugged_std2 <- dd$rugged_std - 0.215
dd$cid_f <- as.factor(dd$cid)

m8.3.lm <- lm(log_gdp_std ~ cid_f * rugged_std2, data = dd)

## This is equivalent to 
## m8.3.lm <- lm(log_gdp_std ~ cid_f + rugged_std2 + cid_f:rugged_std2, data = dd)

m8.3.lm
```

However, this model is not equivalent to the model SR wants us to fit. Here **(Intercept)** is the intercept for the regression for Africa and **cid_f2** is the difference between Africa and non-Africa. If we want non-Africa we need to do `r 0.8840 + 0.1671`. Similarly, the slope for Africa is **0.1387** and for non-Africa `r 0.1387 + (-0.2865)`.

Looking at the model matrix might help

```{r}
round(head(model.matrix(m8.3.lm)), 2)
```

If we want to set up the model with **lm** the way SR likes it we need.

```{r}
m8.3.lm2 <- lm(log_gdp_std ~ cid_f + rugged_std2:cid_f - 1, data = dd)
```

Now, **cid_f1** is the intercept for Africa, **cid_f2** is the intercept for non-Africa. **cid_f1:rugged_std2** is the slope for Africa and **cid_f2:rugged_std2** is the slope for non-Africa.  In the book, **cid_f1** equates to **a[1]** and **cid_f2** to **a[2]**. Similarly, **cid_f1:rugged_std2** equates to **b[1]** and **cif_f2:rugged_std2** to **b[2]**. We can get confidence intervals in the following way.

```{r}
round( confint(m8.3.lm2), 2)
```

The model matrix is now

```{r}
round(head(model.matrix(m8.3.lm2)), 2)
```

## Bayesian: brms

When trying to fit the same model with *brms* things are a little bit different.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
## Easy brms. This model is the Bayesian version of the model m8.3.lm above
## But again this is not the same as in the book
m8.3.brms1 <- brm(log_gdp_std ~ cid_f + rugged_std2 + cid_f:rugged_std2, 
                  data = dd)

## Also, it does not have explicit priors for the model parameters
## What is brms doing under the hood?
prior_summary(m8.3.brms1)

## This is what we need to do to generate a model equivalent to 
## m8.3.lm2 above
m8.3.brms2 <- brm(log_gdp_std ~ 0 + cid_f + cid_f:rugged_std2, 
                 data = dd)

## Still does not have explicit priors
prior_summary(m8.3.brms2)

## Now that I know what the model looks like
## I can define explicit priors
## for all parameters
prs <- prior(normal(1, 0.1), coef = "cid_f1") + 
  prior(normal(1, 0.1), coef = "cid_f2") +
  prior(normal(0, 0.3), coef = "cid_f1:rugged_std2") + 
  prior(normal(0, 0.3), coef = "cid_f2:rugged_std2") +
  prior(exponential(1), class = "sigma")

m8.3.brms3 <- brm(log_gdp_std ~ 0 + cid_f + cid_f:rugged_std2, 
                 data = dd, prior = prs)

prior_summary(m8.3.brms3)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}
## Different version from
## https://bookdown.org/content/4857/markov-chain-monte-carlo.html#good-king-markov-and-his-island-kingdom
## This version is more complicated and it turns the model into a nonlinear one
## just so that we can define the parameters in terms of 'a' and 'b'
dd$cid <- ifelse(dd$cid == 1, "1", "2")
m8.3.brms4 <- 
  brm(data = dd, 
      family = gaussian,
      bf(log_gdp_std ~ 0 + a + b * (rugged_std - 0.215), 
         a ~ 0 + cid, 
         b ~ 0 + cid,
         nl = TRUE),
      prior = c(prior(normal(1, 0.1), class = b, coef = "cid1", nlpar = a),
                prior(normal(1, 0.1), class = b, coef = "cid2", nlpar = a),
                prior(normal(0, 0.3), class = b, coef = "cid1", nlpar = b),
                prior(normal(0, 0.3), class = b, coef = "cid2", nlpar = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      chains = 1, cores = 1,
      seed = 9)
## Priors
prior_summary(m8.3.brms4)
```
