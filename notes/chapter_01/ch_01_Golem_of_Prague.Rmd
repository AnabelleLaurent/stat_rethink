These are notes on chapter 1 for the book "Statistical Rethinking" by Richard McElreath

# Chapter 1: Golem of Prague

The golem is a metaphor for a model which could be conceptual, mathematical or statistical. The golem (model) executes instructions as told and the scientific insights might be inspired or challenged by how it behaves.


> models are powerful, but clumsy; they challenge and inspire intuition. 

> There is no wisdom in the golem 

> No statistical tool (or model) does anything on its own to address the basic problem of inferring causes from evidence

## The problem with inference

In the book the author makes a distinction between hypothesis and models. There is great difficulty sometimes to connect a vague scientific hypothesis with an underlying process and finally with a statistical model that is faithful to the process and the hypothesis.        

We want: $\text{cause} \rightarrow \text{effect}$, but we get $x$ associated with  $y$.
