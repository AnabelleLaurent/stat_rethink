# Conditional Manatees

This chapter is all about interactions and it does get into the nuts and bolts about how they are built. Not as many crucial concepts and philosophical insights.

## Interactions

The first figure is an example of a lack of interaction. The difference between level 1 and level 2 of factor A is more or less constant across continuous factor x.

This second figure is an example of an interaction. The difference between level 1 and level 2 of factor A is not constant across continuous factor x.

This third figure is an example of a cross-over interaction. The difference between level 1 and level 2 of factor A is reversed across continuous factor x.

## Symmetry of interactions

> Interactions are like Buridan's ass. Like two piles of identical food, a simple interaction model contains two symmetrical interpretations

On page 251 he poses two equivalent ways of thinking about the interaction. Only the first one makes sense to me.

What McElreath calls *counter-factual* plots are very useful for understanding interactions.
